# hello-world

My name is Sarah and I'm just starting out in this fantastical online world, having completed a data science bootcamp through HyperionDev. 

A little something about me: 
I can't start my day without a great cup of coffee, 
I'm really enjoying learning about various branches of IT, especially data analyis and AI  
and I'm looking forward to adding and working on many cool projects
